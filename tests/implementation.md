### Purpose of Each File
- `data/`: Directory containing synthetic and SAR images for testing.
- `src/aisukf.py`: Core implementation of the Adaptive ISUKF algorithm.
- `src/image_registration.py`: Functions for registering low-resolution images.
- `src/noise_estimation.py`: Algorithms to estimate noise variance in SAR images.
- `src/evaluation_metrics.py`: Functions to compute performance metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM).
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the source code to ensure the correctness of implementations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, usage instructions, and how to run tests.

### Main Entry Point
The main entry point for running the AISUKF process will be the `aisukf.py` module.

### External Libraries
- Python Imaging Library (PIL)
  
### Dataset Requirements and Sources

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Model Representation and Initialization
- Implement functions to initialize noise variances and covariance matrices.

```python
# src/aisukf.py

def initialize_params():
    V0 = 0.5                      # Measurement noise covariance
    Q0 = 0.01                     # Process noise covariance
    L = 15                        # Window size for covariance matching
    return V0, Q0, L
```

### Step 2: Prediction Step
- Compute sigma points and their weights based on the previous time step.

```python
# src/aisukf.py

def compute_sigma_points(z_bar, P, n_a, lambda_):
    sqrt_P = np.sqrt((n_a + lambda_) * P)
    return np.concatenate((z_bar[:, None], z_bar[:, None] + sqrt_P, z_bar[:, None] - sqrt_P), axis=1)
```

### Step 3: Updation Step
- Update intensity estimates and error covariances based on the transformed sigma points.

```python
# src/aisukf.py

def update_estimates(sigma_points, measurements, P, V, weights_mean, weights_cov):
    # Update equations as per Equation (9) to (14) of the paper
```

### Step 4: Adaptive Noise Estimation
- Implement methods to adaptively compute measurement noise `Vt` and process noise `Qt`.

```python
# src/noise_estimation.py

def adaptive_noise_estimation(errors, sigma_points, weights_cov):
    # Implement equations (15) to (18)
```

### Step 5: Full AISUKF Implementation
- Coordinate the above components to iteratively run for T times using a loop within `aisukf.py`.

```python
# src/aisukf.py

def run_aisukf(lr_images):
    V0, Q0, L = initialize_params()
    for t in range(T):
        # Extract measurements and call prediction and update functions
```

## 4. Data Processing

### Dataset Preparation Steps
1. Load low-resolution (LR) images from the `data/synthetic_images/` and `data/sar_images/` directories.
2. For synthetic images, apply simulated speckle noise with variance = 0.01.
3. Store registered images.

### Data Preprocessing Requirements
- Normalize pixel values of all images to [0, 1] range for consistency.
- Ensure images have consistent dimensions required for processing.

### Expected Data Formats and Structures
- LR images should be in a format supported by OpenCV (e.g., .png, .jpg).
- The images must be preprocessed with the correct dimensions (e.g., `(128, 128)`).

This structured plan provides a clear path towards implementing the methodology of the Adaptive ISUKF for the super-resolution of SAR images based on the specified research paper. Each component can be modularized for ease of testing and maintenance.
