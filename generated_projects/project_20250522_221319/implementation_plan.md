# Implementation Plan for Multi-Spectral Image Enhancement Algorithm

The implementation plan for the paper on maintaining original gray levels during image enhancement involves creating a structured application that includes multiple components for dataset handling, algorithm execution, and evaluation. Below is a detailed breakdown of the necessary steps to build this project.

### File Directory Purpose
- `data/`: Directory to store datasets.
  - `raw/`: Original multi-spectral images.
  - `processed/`: Intermediate processed images.
  - `results/`: Output images after enhancement.
  
- `src/`: Source code directory.
  - `image_enhancement.py`: Contains the main image enhancement algorithm.
  - `filters.py`: Implements the specific filters (e.g., Butterworth high pass).
  - `utilities.py`: Contains utility functions for frame processing and histogram calculations.
  - `visualizations.py`: Functions for displaying images and visualizing histograms.

- `tests/`: Unit tests for all functionalities.
  
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies needed to run the application.

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application which will execute the enhancement process.

## 2. Dependencies

### Required Python Packages
- `numpy==1.21.2`: For numerical computations.
- `opencv-python==4.5.3.20210927`: For image processing.
- `scikit-image==0.18.3`: For image enhancement and feature extraction.
- `matplotlib==3.4.3`: For plotting and visualizations.

### External Libraries and Tools
- You may need to install `OpenCV` for image manipulation tasks.

### Dataset Requirements and Sources
- Acquire 6 narrow-band multi-spectral images (these should be in formats like TIFF or PNG).
- Data sources can be scientific repositories or datasets available from image processing competitions.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Code Breakdown
1. **Image Loading and Processing**: 
   - Implement the image loading function in `utilities.py`.
   - Use OpenCV to read images and store them in arrays.

2. **Histogram Calculation**:
   - Implement histogram calculation using formulas from the research (Equations 1 and 2) in `utilities.py`.

3. **Filter Design (Butterworth High Pass Filter)**:
   - Implement the Butterworth filter function in `filters.py`.
   - Follow the proposed three-part filter design to keep low, enhance intermediate, and reduce high frequencies.

   ```python
   def butterworth_high_pass(cutoff, order=2):
       # Implementation based on standard Butterworth filter design
       pass
   ```

4. **Enhancement Algorithm**:
   - In `image_enhancement.py`, implement the algorithm based on the proposed method maintaining gray levels while enhancing sharpness and suppressing noise.

   ```python
   def enhance_image(image):
       # Apply Butterworth filter
       # Maintain gray levels
       # Return enhanced image
       pass
   ```

5. **Result Evaluation**:
   - Create functionalities to evaluate and compare the sharpness between original and enhanced images using subjective measures (visualization) and objective metrics.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Implement plot functions in `visualizations.py` to visualize image results and histograms.

7. **Main Execution**:
   - In `main.py`, implement the orchestration of loading images, applying enhancement, saving results, and visualizing outputs.

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Load images, apply enhancement, save results
       pass
   ```

## 4. Data Processing

### Dataset Preparation Steps
- Collect the specified multi-spectral images and place them in `data/raw/`.

### Data Preprocessing Requirements
- Convert images to a standard format (if necessary).
- Ensure all images are of the same dimensions for processing.

### Expected Data Formats and Structures
- Images should be in multi-channel formats (e.g., 6 channels for the narrow-band multi-spectral images).
- After enhancement, output images should retain the same dimensions and channel structure.

This structured implementation plan provides a clear path for converting the concepts from the research paper into a functional codebase, facilitating the enhancement of multi-spectral images while preserving their gray-level information.
