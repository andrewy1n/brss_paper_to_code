# Multi-Spectral Image Enhancement Algorithm

## Overview
Implementation of an image enhancement algorithm that preserves original gray levels while improving detail visibility in multi-spectral images. The method combines frequency domain filtering with noise suppression for optimal results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-image`
