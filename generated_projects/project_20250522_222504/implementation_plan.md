## 2. Dependencies

- Required Python packages:
  - `numpy>=1.21.0`
  - `opencv-python>=4.5.1`
  - `matplotlib>=3.4.3`
  - `scikit-image>=0.18.3`

- External libraries and tools: No specific external tools outside of Python packages are required for this implementation.

- Dataset requirements: 
  - Input dataset: Six narrow-bands multi-spectral images should be provided in TIFF format under `data/input_images`.

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Image Reading:**
   - Implement a function in `image_processing.py` to read images from `data/input_images/`.

    ```python
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    
    def read_images(image_paths):
        images = []
        for path in image_paths:
            image = cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)  # Read the image in the same gray scale
            images.append(image)
        return images
    ```

2. **Histogram Calculation:**
   - Implement a function in `histogram.py` to calculate and plot histograms for input and output images.

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    def plot_histogram(image, title='Histogram'):
        plt.hist(image.ravel(), bins=256, range=[0, 256])
        plt.title(title)
        plt.show()
    ```

3. **Butterworth High-Pass Filter Implementation:**
   - Create a function in `filters.py` for the Butterworth filter which will keep low frequencies, enhance middle frequencies, and suppress high frequencies.

    ```python
    def butterworth_highpass_filter(image, d0, order=2):
        # Detailed algorithm
        # Implementation goes here ...
        return filtered_image
    ```

4. **Image Enhancement Algorithm:**
   - In `image_processing.py`, implement the main image enhancement pipeline combining the above elements:
     - Keep original gray levels.
     - Enhance details using the Butterworth filter.
     - Suppress noise on the high-frequency components.

    ```python
    def enhance_image(original_image):
        low_pass_filtered = butterworth_highpass_filter(original_image, d0=30, order=2)
        # Additional processing...
        return enhanced_image
    ```

5. **Main Entry Point:**
   - In `main.py`, implement the logic to load images, apply the enhancement function, calculate histograms before and after enhancement, and save the output images.

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        image_paths = [
            'data/input_images/image_430nm.tif',
            'data/input_images/image_460nm.tif',
            # Add paths for other images
        ]
        
        images = read_images(image_paths)
        for i, image in enumerate(images):
            enhanced_image = enhance_image(image)
            plot_histogram(image, title=f'Original Histogram {i}')
            plot_histogram(enhanced_image, title=f'Enhanced Histogram {i}')
            cv2.imwrite(f'data/output_images/enhanced_image_{i}.tif', enhanced_image)
    ```

## 4. Data Processing

- **Dataset Preparation Steps:**
  - Collect six narrow-band multi-spectral images.
  - Store them in `data/input_images/` directory in TIFF format.

- **Data Preprocessing Requirements:**
  - Ensure images are in the correct format (TIFF) and adequately sized for processing.
  - Normalize grayscale levels if necessary by ensuring consistent image depth.

- **Expected Data Formats and Structures:**
  - Each image should be a 2D (for grayscale) or 3D (for multi-spectral) array.
  - Output images should be stored as similar formats in the `data/output_images/` directory.

This structured implementation plan should guide you through the process of developing the proposed image enhancement algorithm while maintaining original gray levels as outlined in the research paper.
